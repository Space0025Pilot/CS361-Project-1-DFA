I would say that this project was an ok project. Initially, I really had a hard time getting started as I felt it wasn't clear on exactly what we needed to do. Quite a bit of the project was left open for interpretation and design so that made it a bit more difficult when asking for guidance at specific points in the project. What worked well was the files that were given to us and how to structure them! I found this the easiest part of the project. One of the techniques we used was to try and make our code as simple as possible that way when we went back for testing that it was only minor changes to the code and we had an easier time figuring out where and what the problem was. The debugger was helpful to figure out what problems where going on. When it throws an exception or the like it is had to truly know what you need to fix until you can get into the code and see exactly what it is doing and whether or not that matches up with what we believe and need it to do. 
The overall design process I think I would do some psuedocode and draw it out first next time. That way I can better build a foundation for myself just by way of understanding the project and beginning the initial work with it. If I could go back in time, I would tell myself to start earlier and draw it out first before just jumping into the code.

Write a brief (2-3 paragraph) reflection describing your experience with this 
project. Answer the following questions (but feel free to add other insights): 
- What worked well and what was a struggle?
- What concepts still aren't quite clear?
- What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?
- What would you change about your design process?
- If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?

## Compiling and Using

There isn't any user input required for this code. It is tested through the test cases.

## Sources used

None other than the instruction guide, java documentation, and the professor.
